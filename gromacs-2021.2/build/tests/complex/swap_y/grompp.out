Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.005 kJ/mol/ps at 300 K

Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 1.080 nm, buffer size 0.080 nm

Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 1.011 nm, buffer size 0.011 nm

Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup
Calculating fourier grid dimensions for X Y Z
Using a fourier grid of 32x72x32, spacing 0.135 0.134 0.135

Estimate for the relative computational load of the PME mesh part: 0.27

This run will generate roughly 3 Mb of data

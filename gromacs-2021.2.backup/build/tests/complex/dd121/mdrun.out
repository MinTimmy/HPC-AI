Reading file topol.tpr, VERSION 2021.2 (single precision)
Can not increase nstlist because verlet-buffer-tolerance is not set or used
Using 12 MPI threads
Using 1 OpenMP thread per tMPI thread


WARNING: Oversubscribing the available 8 logical CPU cores with 12 thread-MPI threads.
         This will cause considerable performance loss.

NOTE: Oversubscribing the CPU, will not pin threads
starting mdrun 'Protein'

Writing final coordinates.


Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was off during the run due to low measured imbalance.
 Average load imbalance: 12.1%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 6%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 0.8%.


NOTE: 13 % of the run time was spent in domain decomposition,
      0 % of the run time was spent in pair search,
      you might want to increase nstlist (this has no effect on accuracy)
